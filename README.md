# Pitch_Classification
This is an unsupervised learning model that uses various inputs from statcast and pitchfx to cluster and ultimately classify the pitch type from a certain pitcher. In this example analysis, we analyze Max Scherzer's pitches from the 2019 season. The .html file is a Jupyter slide deck that walks through the analysis including background, methods, and key takeaways.
